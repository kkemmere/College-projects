This assignment was tough for me, my initial design was to first set up the Pre-order, Post-order, and Level-order traversals which i was able to
do. Next was to set up the tree such that i could input values into a string array for each line that is read from the file. The problem
i had here was setting up the tree and having the pointers for the nodes work with multiple arrays. I eventually gave up on this part and
decided to read the file each line at a time and put it into the tree manually because setting up an array of Nodes and having those nodes
point to each other like a tree would be a tricky task. Eventually i got to the point where i was able to use a test tree and my traversal
methods as well as the height method to print out the correct height of the tree. The method i had the most problems with was the insert
method. For some reason mine wouldn't work the way i wanted it to and i was running out of time to complete the assignment. My find
or more of a contains method sort of works in a way but on some values in the tree it wont recognize them. All in all this assignment was tough
i wasn't able to get my initial design to work so i had to improvise to complete the task in a more simple but tedious way. The only problem is
if you were to input new values into the tree.dat file they would have to be input the same way the original values were to get the correct traversals
and height of the tree. Another problem i ran into was how to set up the generic tree such that if it reads the first value it knows that each node will
only have said amount of children. I couldn't figure out how to implement that into my code.
